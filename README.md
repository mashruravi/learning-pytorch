Code + Notes while learning Pytorch

## To Do

 - [x] Code to use GPU
 - [x] Print time taken for each epoch
 - [ ] Run validation after each epoch
 - [ ] During validation: print status (% correct classification) for each class
 - [ ] Better progress display (using tqdm)
  - [ ] Show custom metrics in progress bar (e.g. running loss)
  - [ ] Print other contents below progress bar without new progress bar starting
 - [ ] Save best weights at the end of epoch
